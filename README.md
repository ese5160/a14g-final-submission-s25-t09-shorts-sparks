## 1. Video Presentation

## 2. Project Summary

Device Description:  
Give a 2 sentence description of your device.
- A boat active stabilization device (Seakeeper) to combat the rocking (roll) motion of a boat at sea due to waves, improving rider comfort. The system uses an IMU to detect boat tilting and uses the gyroscopic precession effect of a spinning flywheel to counteract the motion.

What inspired you to do the project? What problem is your device solving?

How do you use the Internet to augment your device functionality?

Device Functionality
Explain how your Internet-connected device is designed

Include sensors, actuators, and other critical components.

Include your system-level block diagram here.

Challenges
Where did you face difficulties? This could be in firmware, hardware, software, integration, etc.

How did you overcome these challenges?

Prototype Learnings
What lessons did you learn by building and testing this prototype?

What would you do differently if you had to build this device again?

Next Steps & Takeaways
What steps are needed to finish or improve this project?

What did you learn in ESE5160 through the lectures, assignments, and this course-long prototyping project?

Project Links
Provide a URL to your Node-RED instance for our review (make sure itâ€™s running on your Azure instance!)

Provide the share link to your final PCBA on Altium 365.

Consider downloading your PCBA source and manufacturing files to keep after you leave UPenn. Your Altium access will expire after this semester.


## 3. Hardware & Software Requirements

Note: Since we had a late project change, we have created new HRS and SRS for the new project (post-facto) based on our goals when this project was created. We are evaluating our final output relative to these goals of the ideal new project expectations.

### HRS

IMU shall sample at least at 200 Hz (we will request measurements at 200 Hz for kalman filter input)

MCU (capabilities?) (at least FM i2c?, WIFI, PWM, SPI, ..., flash space for bootloader and Application code)

SD card access at ... speed, sapce for application code files

DC motor driven at least 24V 5??A (MOSFET + gate drive) - show DC Eload as proof of capability

Use the PCBA made for the original project as much as possible

Stepper motor - Fail --> servo motor from another SAMW pin

### SRS

UART SAMW to SAMD for communication between mcus on board - Fail -->

PWM at 10khz (ish) for 

Ramp changes in dc motor PWM for ...

Node red / wifi interfacing for remote data show and user input

OTAFU implemented (show node red and / or cli) (note bootloader existance?)

Drivers?

Requests and receives imu data at 200 hz to input into 200hz kalman filter -> 100hz pid motor control loop


## 4. Project Photos & Screenshots

## Codebase

- A link to your final embedded C firmware codebases
- A link to your Node-RED dashboard code
- Links to any other software required for the functionality of your device
