## 2. Project Summary

### Device Description:  

Brief Project Description.

- Our final device is a boat active stabilization device (Seakeeper) to combat the rocking (roll) motion of a boat at sea due to waves, improving rider comfort. The system uses an IMU to detect boat tilting and uses the gyroscopic precession effect of a spinning flywheel to counteract the motion.
- For most of the semester, our project was a 3 axis CNC machine for milling prototype PCBs. Due to board issues discovered and isolated to problems outside of our control during board bringup, we worked with the Teaching Team to do a very late project change to salvage our PCB in a demoable project. Read here for more information on board issues: [Board Issues Google Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17aVozhZWAjP6q5agUZiOJsjJb8daSV915WeSpyRnOJc/edit?usp=sharing)

What inspired you to do the project? What problem is your device solving?

- The inspiration for our project was less of an "inspiration", more of a "maximize what we had". PCB manufacturing issues made our original project (3 axis CNC machine for milling prototype PCBs) impossible due to some critical component failures. We took everything that we found functional on our PCB, and asked ourselves what is the coolest project we could make. Specifically, the most functional of our three boards was semi functional including the SAMW25, MOSFET + gate drive IC for a big DC motor, separate SAMD21, stepper driver, all of the power regulation (24V, 5V, 3.3V) and a QWIIC connector for external I2C. From here, we came up with the boat stabilizer idea (control moment gyro/CMG) as it perfectly maximizes our functional hrdware. Our original CNC spindle motor was repurposed to spin a flywheel, the stepper motor connected to the SAMD21 could be used as the gimbal actuator (later decided to use a simple servo controlled by the SAMW25 instead), and the QWIIC connector allows us to connect an external IMU to measure a the tilt of a boat so that the CMG could actively compensate and counteract the rocking motion.

How do you use the Internet to augment your device functionality?

- The stabilization device could also be activated remotely (e.g. on a private yatch, the user does not need to go to the control room and could activate it from their phone/internet connected device). The data of the boat's tilt is also transfered live to a dashboard which anyone anywhere could see, such as friends and family on shore. In addition, this allows for additional features such as "text emergency contact" when the boat is detected to have capsized in rough waters.

### Device Functionality

The entire system revolves(get it? haha) around the flywheel. Using the principle of gyroscopic precession, this allows us to tilt the flywheel back and forth (pitch), and produce a rolling tourque to counteract waves rocking a boat (usually boats are longer than they are wide so the largest tilt is in this axis). Our large DC motor (original CNC spindle), will spin up a laser cut disk with slots for 16 large bolts along the circomference (DIY flywheel with max rotational inertia). This inertia combined with a very high RPM (~5000 with 25% full power) gives us a large amount of stored angular momentum to use and counteract the boat rocking side to side. A servo motor is used to act as the gimbal actuator to tilt the flywheel assembly back and forth as it is very simple and provides decent torque. An IMU is used which allows us to measure current tilt and correct for it inside of a PID loop (originally also planend for a kalman filter with sensor fusion bt once again time was extreemly limited). All of the processing is handled by the SAMW25 which runs Free RTOS to simultaneously perform active stability compensation and other tasks such as CLI, and WIFI communication with Node-Red Dashboard.

### Challenges

Where did you face difficulties? This could be in firmware, hardware, software, integration, etc.

- Our major challenge was hardware (and as a result a lack of time), due to unforseen factors from the manufactures that caused several unfixable PCB issues (possibly due to wrong reflow temperature that killed the ICs). This quite literally killed our original project, leaving us only 3 days to try to implement and demo a new project from scratch. Again, this document provides specific information on board issues: [Board Issues Google Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17aVozhZWAjP6q5agUZiOJsjJb8daSV915WeSpyRnOJc/edit?usp=sharing)

- The new project suffered from lack of development/debugging time, with potential further hardware issues that we did not have time to pinpoint (unable to move our gimbal actuator as we could not get a second PWM instance on a different tcc unit to output from other pins. Tried 8 total pins, only the one used for the flywheel motor worked). This meant that we were unable to demonstrate the full integrated active roll compensation (which was the main selling point).

How did you overcome these challenges?

- These fundamental challenges were in a way "impossible" to overcome, but we were able to make the most out of what was possible. Over the course of 3 days into the demo and a few hours of refinement post-demo day (Node-RED otafu and additional servo troubleshooting), we were able to: 
   1. Successfully completed a new mechanical CAD and finished the physical construction which had all the necessary features of a fully functioning CMG.
   2. Rebuilt our Node-RED rebuilt dashboard interface, integrated flywheel power setting, logging IMU data (boat tilt), manual/automatic activation of the system, OTAFU, boat capsize detection that will alert the dashboard and text a phone number.
   3. Wrote drivers for our new I2C device (IMU), and successfully read out the data of interest and send over to dashboard for data visualization + logging.
   4. Wrote a motor dc control driver that will ramp up/dpwn the speed to any user set speed from the dashboard.

- Due to potentially even more hardware issue, we were unable to generate a second PWM for the gimbal actuator (servo), which unfortunately also limited our ability to do a full integration of everything. Some of the attempted pins did generate pwm using the dev board, but given the end of semester and final exams, we did not have time to completely isolate and troubleshoot this issue to a resolution.

### Prototype Learnings

What lessons did you learn by building and testing this prototype?

- We learned a lot about the manufacturing and developing process and considerations to make in the planning and execution stages of prototyping.
    - Design your intial PCB prototype to be easily reworkable to make up for both design and manufacturing mistakes
    - Understand your manufacturer capabilities by developing subsection or component test boards (this can also help you get a sense of layout and routing regarding said component). This can help make sure the manufacturing process, such as reflow temp, is successful with the IC before integrating into the larger system
- How to isolate/assess the where issues come from between design, firmware, and chip / manufacturing issues
- Gain famililiarity on dev board to get code / mcu development familiarity before doing pin assigment on PCBA
- Many more!

What would you do differently if you had to build this device again?

- One thing I would do differently is minimizing risk from the beginning of the project. Either modifying the initial idea CNC or conceptulizing it in a way that the whole system can run from a single PCBA would have been helpful for mitigating risk with board manufacturing issues.
- Overall, if done outside the time constraints of the course I have tried to develop a whole working system or at least proof of concept on development boards to get more familiar with the components and firmware considerations before PCB design. This would also help mitigate firmware vs hardware vs manufacturing issues when doing board bringup and final development and integration of the device on the PCBAs.
- A small change for the PCBs would be using slightly larger test points and traces whenever possible, which would have made rework soldering a bit more pleasant.
- I think our approach to the second project was mostly good, but again mitigating risk would have saved some time. For instance, we thought we could still use both MCUs and the stepper motor driver, and I spent some time trying to put together a rushed UART commincation between the MCUs by repurposing pin connections from the original CNC idea. This made the implementation of the system unecessarily complex, and wasted time. Eventually we gave up on that and switched to a servo using SAMW25 pwm, which could have been done from the beginning

### Next Steps & Takeaways

What steps are needed to finish or improve this project?

- For the Gyro, next steps would to be find and resolve the TCC PWM issue on all other pins and use a working pin for the servo motor. Then develop a driver for the servo to ramp speed to provide torque to boat
    - Implement kalman filter for sensor fusion
    - Implement PID for tilt compensation (moving servo)

What did you learn in ESE5160 through the lectures, assignments, and this course-long prototyping project?

- The lectures gave a initial idea of embedded design considerations, the approach to Altium, RTOS fundamentals, and bootloader and otafu fundamentals
- The assignments expanded on these and gave opportunity for practical implementation experience and a deeper understanding

## 3. Hardware & Software Requirements

Note: Since we had a late project change, we have created new HRS and SRS for the new project (post-facto) based on our goals when this project was created. We will attempt to evaluate our final output relative to these goals that reflect the ideal new project expectations. We recognize that some of these requirements are very basic and could be developed much further to frame a project, but since they were made post facto and again very limited time (we focused more on actual implementation for as long as possible) we hope this is sufficient to have some picutre of the intentions
